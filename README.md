## Unsloth Finetuning
This repository contains code and resources for finetuning the Unsloth model for various NLP tasks. The Unsloth model is designed to be efficient and effective for a wide range of applications.

## RAG

The Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach combines pre-trained language models with a retrieval mechanism to enhance the model's ability to generate accurate and contextually relevant responses. This repository includes implementations and examples of RAG techniques applied to the Unsloth model.

## TTS - STT I/O
This repository also includes tools and scripts for Text-to-Speech (TTS) and Speech-to-Text (STT) functionalities. These components allow for seamless integration of voice input and output in applications utilizing the Unsloth model.
